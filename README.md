HACKBIO INTERNSHIP- STAGE 0 TASK


INTRODUCTION

This repository contains my submission for the Stage Zero Task of the HackBio Internship.
The task involved using a suitable data structure to organize and display information in Python or R, without using functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

For this task, I used a nested dictionary in Python to store and structure the required data. 
A nested dictionary helps organize related information in a structured format, making it easy to retrieve and display.

HOW THE CODE WORKS

1. Creating a Nested Dictionary

    The data was stored in a nested dictionary, where each key represents a person, and the value is another dictionary containing their details.

2. Printing the Data (Without Loops, functions and conditional)

    Since the use of complex concepts was prohibited in this task, each entry was manually retrieved and displayed using the print function.

3. Expected Output

    The output displays the information in a structured and readable format.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE


1.Ensure you have Python installed and running on your system.


2.Type the code into a Python script or an interactive shell, then use the print function to display the output.

Team Contribution

This task was completed as part of a team effort, where each member worked on structuring the data and ensuring the output was clear and organized.

The steps outlined above were used to organize the team's information into a structured format, as shown in the script file in this repository.
