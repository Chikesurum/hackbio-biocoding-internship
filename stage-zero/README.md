HackBio Internship, STAGE 0 Task.



INTRODUCTION

This repository contains my submission for the First Task of the HackBio Internship. The task involved using a suitable data structure to organize and display information in Python or R, without using functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts.



PROJECT DESCRIPTION

For this task, I used a nested dictionary in Python to store and structure the required data.
A nested dictionary helps organize related information in a structured format, making it easy to retrieve and display.



HOW THE CODE WORKS

1. Creating a Nested Dictionary

    The data was stored in a nested dictionary, where each key represents a person, and the value is another dictionary containing their details.

2. Printing the Data (Without Loops)

    Since Functions,loops and conditionals were not allowed, each entry was manually retrieved and displayed using the print function.

3. Expected Output

    The output displays the information in a structured and readable format.

   


STEPS TO CREATE A NESTED DICTIONARY

Define the main dictionary using curly brackets {}.

Create nested dictionaries inside it, where each key represents a unique name or category.

Store details inside each nested dictionary as key-value pairs.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE

1. Ensure you have Python installed and running on your system.

2. Type the code into a Python script or an interactive shell.
  
3. Manually retrieve each entry from our dictionary by using the print function to display the stored information in a clear and structured format.
